            answer:
              "We primarily support Amazon sellers, Shopify stores, WooCommerce sites, and direct-to-consumer (DTC) brands. Our platform is designed with small to mid-sized e-commerce sellers in mind, though we also serve agencies managing multiple seller accounts and some enterprise brands.",

              "Smart Funnels use conditional logic to filter customers based on their satisfaction ratings. For example, customers who rate their experience 4-5 stars are directed to leave public reviews, while those with lower ratings are routed to private feedback forms.

              "Our incentive system allows you to offer coupons, discounts, or other rewards for completing surveys or specific actions. This feature is available for both Amazon and non-Amazon campaigns, however it's important that sellers use this feature wisely when creating Amazon-related campaigns.

These funnels don't use rating gates, incentives, or any tactics that could violate Amazon's Terms of Service. We stay updated on Amazon's policy changes and adjust our platform accordingly. As long as you follow our guidelines, you should be fine. However, if you choose to experiment with settings on your own, we cannot be held responsible for any outcomes.

            answer:
              "Amazon-compliant funnels request reviews from all customers equally, don't offer incentives for reviews, don't gate review requests based on ratings, and use neutral language that doesn't bias customer responses. Our Compliant Mode automatically enforces these rules.",
